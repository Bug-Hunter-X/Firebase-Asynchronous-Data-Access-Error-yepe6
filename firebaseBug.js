The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data you're trying to access is not yet available or has been deleted. This is usually an asynchronous operation, and if you try to access the data before the asynchronous call has completed, you'll encounter this error.  For example, in a Cloud Firestore query, if you try to read the result immediately after performing a `get()` or `onSnapshot()` operation, it might still be pending.
